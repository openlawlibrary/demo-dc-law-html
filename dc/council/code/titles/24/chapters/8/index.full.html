            <p>The Interstate Agreement on Detainers is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the United States on its own behalf and on behalf of the District of Columbia with all jurisdictions legally joining in substantially the form set forth in this section.</p>
            <p>The contracting States solemnly agree that:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-heading">ARTICLE</span> <span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#I">I</span> The party States find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party States and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints. The party States also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-heading">ARTICLE</span> <span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#II">II</span> As used in this agreement:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#II(a)">(a)</span> “State” shall mean a State of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#II(b)">(b)</span> “Sending State” shall mean a State in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#II(c)">(c)</span> “Receiving State” shall mean the State in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information, or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-heading">ARTICLE</span> <span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III">III</span><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III(a)">(a)</span> Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party State, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party State any untried indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred and eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer’s jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information, or complaint; provided, that, for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decision of the State parole agency relating to the prisoner.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III(b)">(b)</span> The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III(c)">(c)</span> The warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint on which the detainer is based.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III(d)">(d)</span> Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations, or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the State to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the State to which the prisoner’s request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner’s written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III(e)">(e)</span> Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (b) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving State to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending State. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#III(f)">(f)</span> Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#IV(b)">(b)</span> Upon request of the officer’s written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the State parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving State who has lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#IV(c)">(c)</span> In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred and twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving State, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#IV(d)">(d)</span> Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending State has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#IV(e)">(e)</span> If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner’s being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p>

If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a Federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving State shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner’s presence in Federal custody at the place of trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#V(b)">(b)</span> The officer or other representative of a State accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#V(c)">(c)</span> If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information, or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#V(d)">(d)</span> The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations, or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#V(e)">(e)</span> At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending State.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#V(g)">(g)</span> For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending State and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/24-801.html#V(h)">(h)</span> From the time that a party State receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending State, the State in which the one or more untried indictments, informations, or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping, and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the States concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies, and officers of and in the government of a party State, or between a party State and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.</p>
