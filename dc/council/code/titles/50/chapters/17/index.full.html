            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1701.html#(1)(B)">(B)</span> In 1981, over 600 children of less than 6 years of age were reported injured in motor vehicle accidents in the District of Columbia, reflecting an increase of 16% over reported injuries in 1980 and 40% over reported injuries in 1979;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1701.html#(1)(C)">(C)</span> Young children, due to their small size and early skeletal development, are at a much greater risk of serious bodily injury in motor vehicle accidents than are adults;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1701.html#(1)(D)">(D)</span> Proper use of child restraint seats and safety belts has been estimated to reduce by as much as 90% and 67%, respectively, the fatalities and injuries to children resulting from motor vehicle accidents;</p>

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1701.html#(2)">(2)</span> It is the purpose of this chapter to require that children of less than 16 years of age be protected by being properly restrained in a child restraint seat or safety belt when riding in a motor vehicle.</p>
