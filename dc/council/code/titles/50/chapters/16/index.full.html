            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(1)">(1)</span> Increased use of bicycles for transportation and recreation will result in improved air quality, reduced levels of noise and traffic congestion, greater energy conservation, lower transportation costs, fewer parking problems, and increased physical fitness.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(2)">(2)</span> Bicycle fatalities and accidents can be reduced through broad-based education and facilities improvements.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(4)">(4)</span> A bicycle office is required to coordinate the comprehensive program.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(6)">(6)</span> Each year approximately 290 children are involved in fatal accidents, and nearly 400,000 are injured with varying degrees of severity in bicycle related injuries or crashes.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(7)">(7)</span> Head injuries account for over 60% of bicycle related fatalities and 1/3 of bicycle related emergency room visits.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(8)">(8)</span> Use of a bicycle helmet is the single, most effective preventive measure of reducing head injuries 85%, and brain injuries or serious disabilities by 88% from bicycle accidents.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/dc/council/code/sections/50-1601.html#(9)">(9)</span> Only 15% of bicyclists use proper head protective equipment, and some studies show that bicycle helmet usage for children under 16 years of age ranges from 5% to 15%.</p>
