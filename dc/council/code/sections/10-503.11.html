              <p>Extension of United States Capitol Grounds: Section 739(g)(3) of the Act of December 24, 1973, 87 Stat. 828, Pub. L. 93-198, provided that § 1 of the Act of July 31, 1946, 60 Stat. 718, as amended, is amended to include within the definition of the United States Capitol Grounds the streets as set forth in the Act of December 24, 1973.</p>

              <p>Law Enforcement Authority of Capitol Police: Title I of Act of October 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1949, Pub. L. 102-397, provided that “An Act to define the area of the United States Capitol Grounds, to regulate the use thereof, and for other purposes” is amended to expand the jurisdiction of the Capitol Police.</p>
              <p>Order of House Office Building Commission: By order, dated October 17, 1967, the House Office Building Commission ordered that the Rayburn House Office Building, the subway connecting such building to the Capitol Building, the pedestrian tunnels connecting such building to the Longworth House Office Building, the underground garages in squares 637 and 691 and the tunnels connecting these garages to the House Office Buildings, are declared to be House Office Buildings and, as such, are made subject to the provisions of the Act of July 31, 1946, including any amendments to such Act, which are applicable to the Capitol Buildings.</p>
              <h4>Change in Government</h4>
              <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html#(a)">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
