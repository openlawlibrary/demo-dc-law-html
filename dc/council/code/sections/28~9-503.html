              <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
              <p>1. Source. Subsections (a)(4)(A), (b), and (c) derive from former  Section 9-402(7); otherwise, new.</p>
              <p>2. Debtor’s Name. The requirement that a financing statement provide the debtor’s name is particularly important. Financing statements are indexed under the name of the debtor, and those who wish to find financing statements search for them under the debtor’s name. Subsection (a) explains what the debtor’s name is for purposes of a financing statement. If the debtor is a “registered organization” (defined in  Section 9-102 so as to ordinarily include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies), then the debtor’s name is the name shown on the public records of the debtor’s “jurisdiction of organization” (also defined in  Section 9-102). Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) contain special rules for decedent’s estates and common-law trusts.</p>
              <p>(Subsection (a)(1) applies to business trusts that are registered organizations.)</p>
              <p>Subsection (a)(4)(A) essentially follows the first sentence of former  Section 9-402(7).  Section 1-201(28) defines the term “organization,” which appears in subsection (a)(4), very broadly, to include all legal and commercial entities as well as associations that lack the status of a legal entity. Thus, the term includes corporations, partnerships of all kinds, business trusts, limited liability companies, unincorporated associations, personal trusts, governments, and estates. If the organization has a name, that name is the correct name to put on a financing statement. If the organization does not have a name, then the financing statement should name the individuals or other entities who comprise the organization.</p>
              <p>Together with subsections (b) and (c), subsection (a) reflects the view prevailing under former Article 9 that the actual individual or organizational name of the debtor on a financing statement is both necessary and sufficient, whether or not the financing statement provides trade or other names of the debtor and, if the debtor has a name, whether or not the financing statement provides the names of the partners, members, or associates who comprise the debtor.</p>
              <p>Note that, even if the name provided in an initial financing statement is correct, the filing office nevertheless must reject the financing statement if it does not identify an individual debtor’s last name (e.g., if it is not clear whether the debtor’s name is Perry Mason or Mason Perry). See  Section 9-516(b)(3)(C).</p>
              <p>3. Secured Party’s Name. New subsection (d) makes clear that when the secured party is a representative, a financing statement is sufficient if it names the secured party, whether or not it indicates any representative capacity. Similarly, a financing statement that names a representative of the secured party is sufficient, even if it does not indicate the representative capacity.</p>
              <p>Example: Debtor creates a security interest in favor of Bank X, Bank Y, and Bank Z, but not to their representative, the collateral agent (Bank A). The collateral agent is not itself a secured party. See  Section 9-102. Under  Sections 9-502(a) and  9-503(d), however, a financing statement is effective if it names as secured party Bank A and not the actual secured parties, even if it omits Bank A’s representative capacity.</p>
              <p>Each person whose name is provided in an initial financing statement as the name of the secured party or representative of the secured party is a secured party of record. See  Section 9-511.</p>
              <p>4. Multiple Names. Subsection (e) makes explicit what is implicit under former Article 9: a financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and secured party. See  Section 1-102(5)(a) (words in the singular include the plural). With respect to records relating to more than one debtor, see  Section 9-520(d). With respect to financing statements providing the name of more than one secured party, see  Sections 9-509(e) and  9-510(b).</p>
