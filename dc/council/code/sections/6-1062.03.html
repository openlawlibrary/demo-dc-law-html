            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan presented by the Developer can be used as a model for developing large tracts of underutilized land to create workforce housing, needed community facilities and services, and jobs, and to increase the District’s tax base.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> The Market is an ideal site for transit-oriented development that will increase pedestrian-friendly residential density adjacent to transit facilities that is consistent with the District’s goals of maximizing transit usage while reducing automobile dependency.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(u)">(u)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan will relocate the retail and wholesale operations of the existing Market into modern facilities in the northeast portion of the site which will allow for convenient ingress and egress access for large trailer trucks to and from New York Avenue and Florida Avenue while screening them from residential areas and pedestrian traffic.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(v)">(v)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan provides that the new facilities for the existing retail and wholesale operations will be constructed as condominiums or cooperatives to allow the retailers and wholesalers to own their retail or wholesale facilities.</p>
