The audit shall determine the amount and adequacy of any funding provided by the Water and Sewer Utility Administration for these services. The Mayor shall provide the Council with a final version of the independent audit.

The District government shall retain full legal title to, and a complete equitable interest in, all assets made available for the Authority’s use. Pending the intra-District government transfer required by this subsection, all assets and liabilities of the Water and Sewer Utility Administration, as indicated on the balance sheet prepared by the Water and Sewer Utility Administration just prior to April 18, 1996, shall be transferred for the Authority’s use on an interim basis. Assets made available to the Authority pursuant to this subsection shall remain under the control of the Authority for as long as Authority revenue bonds are outstanding, unless all of the outstanding revenue bonds are defeased pursuant to <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/34-2202.13.html">§ 34-2202.13</a>, or otherwise.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> The study recommendations shall include the manner in which the District would be compensated by the Authority for the District’s historic investment in the capital improvements and maintenance of the Blue Plains facility, should the Authority become an independent regional authority, as well as options for retention by the District of the land upon which any Authority plant and facilities are located within the boundaries of the District.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)">(4)</span> Within 180 days of its inception, the study and its recommendations shall be completed and submitted to the Mayor, the Council, and the appropriate official of each of the other participating jurisdictions.</p>
