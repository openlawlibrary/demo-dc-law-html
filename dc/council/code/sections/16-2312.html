He shall then hear from the Corporation Counsel to determine whether the child should be placed or continued in detention or shelter care under the criteria in section 16-2310. The child and his parent, guardian, or custodian shall have a right to be heard in their own behalf.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> If neglect is alleged, an order of shelter care under this subsection shall include a determination of whether:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)(A)">(A)</span> Reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal, or, in the alternative, a determination that the child’s removal from the home is necessary regardless of any services that could be provided to the child or the child’s family; and</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Continuation of the child in the child’s home would be contrary to the welfare of the child.</p>

The child, his parent, guardian or custodian may present evidence on the issues and be heard in their own behalf.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> When a judge finds there is probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true, he shall order the child to be placed or continued in detention or shelter care and set forth is reasons.

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> On motion by or on behalf of the child, a child in custody shall be released from custody if his detention or shelter care hearing is not commenced within the time set herein.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> If a child is not released after his detention or shelter care hearing and the parent, guardian or custodian did not receive notice thereof, the Division may, in the interest of justice, conduct a new hearing in accordance with rules prescribed by the Superior Court.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> Upon objection of the child or his parent, guardian or custodian, a judge who conducted a detention or shelter care hearing shall not conduct a factfinding hearing on the petition.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> A presumption shall exist that a child will attend the same school that he or she would have attended but for the child’s entry into shelter care, unless it is determined that it is not in the child’s best interest to do so.</p>
