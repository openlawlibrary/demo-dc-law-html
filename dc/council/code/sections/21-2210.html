              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/15-17.html">D.C. Law 15-17</a>, in subsec. (a), inserted “or domestic partner” after “spouse” in par. (2), made a nonsubstantive change in par. (5A), and added par. (5B); and added subsecs. (f) and (g).</p>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/15-105.html">D.C. Law 15-105</a>, in subsec. (g), validated previously made technical corrections.</p>

              <p>The 2012 amendment by <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/19-171.html">D.C. Law 19-171</a> validated a previously made technical correction in (a)(1A).</p>
              <h4>Applicability</h4>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/22-33.html#§7011">Section 7011 of D.C. Law 22-33</a> repealed <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/21-72.html#§4">§ 4 of D.C. Law 21-72</a>. Therefore the creation of this section by <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/21-72.html">D.C. Law 21-72</a> has been implemented.</p>
              <p>
      Applicability of <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/21-72.html">D.C. Law 21-72</a>: <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/21-72.html#§4">§ 4 of D.C.
