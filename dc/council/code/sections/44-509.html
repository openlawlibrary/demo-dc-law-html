(e)(5) and (f). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:</p>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/15-354.html">D.C. Law 15-354</a> substituted “Attorney General for the District of Columbia” for “Corporation Counsel”; and, in subsec. (e)(2), substituted “Administrative Law Judge” for “hearing examiner” and “any orders” for “any orders of the District of Columbia Board of Appeals and Review or”.</p>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/16-191.html">D.C. Law 16-191</a>, in subsec. (f)(2), validated a previously made technical correction.</p>
