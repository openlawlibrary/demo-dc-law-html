In the case of each such easement, the declaration shall contain:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> A description of the permitted use or uses;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> If less than all of those entitled to the use of all the units may utilize such easement, a statement of the relevant restrictions and limitations on utilization; and</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> If any persons other than those entitled to the use of the units may utilize such easement, a statement of the rights of others to utilization of the same.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Wherever this section requires a legally sufficient description of land that is submitted to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, an added requirement shall be a separate legally sufficient description of all lands in which the unit owners shall or may be tenants in common or joint tenants with any other persons, and a separate legally sufficient description of all lands in which the unit owners shall or may be life tenants. No units shall be situated on any such lands, however, and the declaration shall describe the nature of the unit owners’ estates therein. No such lands shall be shown on the same plat or plats showing other portions of the condominium, but shall be shown instead on separate plats.</p>
