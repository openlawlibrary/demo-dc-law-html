              <p>“<a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/46-222.html">§ 46-222</a>. Interstate withholding; procedure for entering a support order of another jurisdiction for withholding.</p>
              <p>“(a) Upon receiving a support order of another jurisdiction from an appropriate agency of the other jurisdiction, with the documentation specified in subsection (c) of this section, the following shall take place:</p>
              <p>“(1) The Clerk of the Family Division of the Court shall accept the documents filed and enter the support order upon the docket and that entry shall constitute acceptance of the support order under this chapter;</p>
              <p>“(2) The Clerk of the Court shall process withholding under this chapter; and</p>
              <p>“(3) The Clerk of the Court shall issue a notice to withhold pursuant to <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/46-211.html">§ 46-211</a> and, within 15 calendar days of locating the obligor or the holder, the Clerk of the Court shall issue a notice of intent to withhold pursuant to <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/46-209.html">§ 46-209</a>, which shall include the following:</p>
              <p>“(A) A statement that, if contested, a support order entered pursuant to this section and the accompanying sworn or certified statement shall constitute prima facie proof, without further proof of foundation, that the support order is valid, that the amount of current support payments and arrearages is as stated, and that the payee would be entitled to withholding under the law of the jurisdiction that issued the support order;</p>
              <p>“(B) A statement that, once a prima facie case has been established, the obligor may raise, in addition to those rights available under this section, only matters that would be available to him as defenses in an action to enforce a foreign money judgment; and</p>
              <p>“(C) A statement that, if the obligor shows to the Court that an appeal from the order is pending, will be taken, or that a stay of execution has been granted, the Court may stay enforcement of the order until the appeal is concluded, the time for appeal has expired, or the order is vacated, upon satisfactory proof that the defendant has furnished security for payment of the support ordered as required by the initiating jurisdiction.</p>
              <p>“(b) Any stay granted as referred to in subsection (a)(3)(C) of this section shall also stay the time limitations for rendering a decision on withholding pursuant to §§ <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/46-216.html#(b)">46-216(b)</a> and <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/46-210.html#(b)">46-210(b)</a>.</p>
              <p>“(c) The following documentation is required for the entry of a support order of another jurisdiction:</p>
              <p>“(1) A certified copy of the support order with all modifications;</p>
              <p>“(2) A certified copy of any income withholding order or notice still in effect;</p>
              <p>“(3) A copy of the portion of the income withholding statute of the jurisdiction that issued the support order, which states the requirements for obtaining income withholding under the law of the jurisdiction;</p>
              <p>“(4) A sworn statement of the obligee or certified statement of the agency of the arrearages, if any; and</p>
              <p>“(5) A statement of:</p>
              <p>“(A) The name, address, and social security number of the obligor, if known;</p>
              <p>“(B) The name and address of the obligor’s employer in this jurisdiction or of any other source of earnings or other income of the obligor derived in the District against which income withholding is sought; and</p>
              <p>“(C) The name and address of the agency or person to whom support payments collected by income withholding shall be transmitted.</p>
              <p>“(d) If the documentation received by the Court pursuant to subsection (a) of this section does not conform to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Court shall remedy any defect that it can without the assistance of the requesting agency or person. If the Court is unable to make the corrections, the requesting agency or person shall be notified of the necessary additions or corrections. If required by the initiating jurisdiction, the Clerk of the Court shall provide the information necessary to carry out the withholding within 30 calendar days of receipt of the initiating jurisdiction’s request for information. The Court shall accept the documentation required by subsections (a) and (c) of this section even if it is not in the usual form required by state or local rules, so long as the substantive requirements of these subsections are met.</p>
              <p>“(e) If the earnings or other income of the obligor is not derived in the District, the Court shall notify the initiating jurisdiction that no action will be taken.</p>
              <p>“(f) Entry of the order shall not confer jurisdiction on the Court for any purpose other than withholding of earnings or other income.</p>
              <p>“(g) The Court, upon receiving a certified copy of any amendment or modification to a support order entered, shall initiate, as though it was a support order of this jurisdiction, necessary procedures to amend or modify the income withholding order or notice of jurisdiction that was based upon the entered support order.</p>
              <p>“(h) If the Court determines that the obligor has obtained employment or has a new or additional source of income in another jurisdiction, it shall notify the agency that requested the income withholding of the changes within 20 working days of receiving the information and shall forward to that agency all information it has or can obtain with respect to the obligor’s new address and the name and address of the obligor’s new employer or other source of income. The Court shall include with the notice a certified copy of any income withholding order in effect in this jurisdiction.”</p>

              <p>“(b) The Court or the IV-D agency shall notify the initiating jurisdiction if it determines that the obligor is no longer employed in the District of Columbia and shall provide to the initiating jurisdiction the name and address of the obligor and the obligor’s new employer, if known.</p>
              <p>“(c) The Court, upon receiving a certified copy of any modification of a support order entered or registered in the District of Columbia, shall initiate necessary procedures to amend or modify the withholding order that was based on the order that has been modified.”</p>
