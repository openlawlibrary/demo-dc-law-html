            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Earning capacity shall be deemed restored if, in each of 2 succeeding calendar years in the case of an annuitant who was an officer or member of the United States Park Police force, United State Secret Service Uniformed Division, or the United States Secret Service Division, or in any calendar year in the case of an annuitant who was an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department, the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both shall be equal to at least 80% of the current rate of compensation of the position occupied immediately prior to retirement. Nothing in this section shall preclude such member from having an annuity reestablished if his disability recurs, or when his earning capacity is less than 80% of the rate of compensation of the position occupied immediately prior to retirement for any full year thereafter; provided, that whenever any member is reinstated with his respective department it shall be at the same grade or rank held by the member at the time of his retirement.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The reductions provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be made as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)(A)">(A)</span> Such reductions shall be prorated over a period of 12 consecutive months, with equal amounts withheld from each payment of annuity during such 12-month period; and</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)(B)">(B)</span> The 12-month period during which such reduction is made shall begin as soon after the end of the calendar year involved as is administratively practicable (as determined in accordance with regulations which the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall promulgate).</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> If the District of Columbia Retirement Board determines that the level of income of an annuitant whose annuity would otherwise be reduced in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection has decreased significantly (other than in accordance with normal income fluctuations for such annuitant) during the period in which such reduction would occur, the District of Columbia Retirement Board may authorize the withholding during such period, or any portion thereof, of such lesser amount than the amount prescribed in such paragraph as the District of Columbia Retirement Board considers appropriate or the District of Columbia Retirement Board may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection if he finds that circumstances justify such waiver.</p>

After examining such statement, the District of Columbia Retirement Board may require such annuitant to submit to the District of Columbia Retirement Board a further notarized statement containing such additional information with respect to the income received by such annuitant from wages or self-employment, or both, as the District of Columbia Retirement Board deems appropriate.</p>

Any such annuitant who refuses or otherwise willfully fails to timely submit such statement as required by this section, payment of the annuity of such annuitant shall cease and such annuitant shall not be eligible to receive such annuity or part thereof for the period beginning on the date after the final day for timely filing of such statement and ending on the date on which the District of Columbia Retirement Board receives such statement. Nothing in this subparagraph shall affect any rights to a survivor’s annuity under <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-716.html">§ 5-716</a> based upon the service of such annuitant.</p>
