              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/16-91.html">D.C. Law 16-91</a> made a technical change in the enacting clause of <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/15-257.html">D.C. Law 15-257</a> which resulted in no change in text.</p>
              <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/20-33.html">D.C. Law 20-33</a> rewrote (c)(2), which read: “Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, the total BID tax due on a property or distinct assembly of properties (if the property occupies more than one taxable lot) in the Capitol Hill BID shall not exceed $75,000.00 in any year”; and added (c)(3).</p>
              <p>The 2015 amendment by <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/20-161.html">D.C. Law 20-161</a> substituted “taxable” for “nonexempt real” in (a); and substituted “taxable” for “nonexempt” twice in (c)(1).</p>
