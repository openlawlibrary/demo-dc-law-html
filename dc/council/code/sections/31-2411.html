            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a civil action for the recovery of any personal injury protection benefits payable under this chapter shall be commenced not later than 3 years after the date of the injury giving rise to entitlement to such benefits.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> If an appropriate written notice setting forth the name and address of the victim and the time, place, and nature of the injury is given to the insurer or any of its authorized agents reasonably promptly after the date of the accident resulting in the injury, a civil action may be commenced at any time within 3 years after the date such a notice is given by a person claiming to be entitled to personal injury protection benefits or by a person acting on behalf of a victim. If the applicable insurer makes any payment of benefits for personal injury protection with respect to a particular victim and injury, then a civil action may be commenced at any time within 3 years after the most recent payment.</p>

A policy of insurance providing for payment of the benefits required for personal injury protection may include reasonable provisions for physical and mental examination of persons claiming any such benefits.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(D)">(D)</span> An applicable insurer may request a person claiming personal injury protection benefits to submit the name and address of each physician, medical-care facility, hospital, clinic, rehabilitation center, nursing facility, or other person or institution that has diagnosed or treated the victim for or with respect to the injury claimed and any relevant past injury, as a prerequisite to the payment of benefits under this chapter.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(E)">(E)</span> A person shall authorize an insurer to inspect and copy records relevant to such a claim which are prepared or maintained by any physician, hospital, clinic, rehabilitation center, nursing facility, or other person or institution.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> A court may make any order which is just in case a person refuses to comply with any provision of paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, except that an order shall not be entered directing the arrest of a person for disobeying an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> An insurer which has paid or become obligated to pay personal injury protection benefits in any case not covered by paragraph (1) of this subsection may agree to receive a right of reimbursement from any other insurer with respect to some or all of those benefits.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Entitlement to reimbursement and the amount of any reimbursement under this subsection shall be determined by agreement between any insurers who are involved under paragraph (1) of this subsection or who agree under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If the insurers fail to reach agreement as to entitlement or amount or both, these issues shall be determined by intercompany arbitration in accordance with any applicable agreement between the insurers involved under procedures established by the Commissioner.

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> The rate of increase will be determined by the Mayor based upon evidence submitted to the Mayor on the reasonableness of the insurance rate and liability limit increase in relation to the need to preserve the economic viability of the taxi industry.</p>
