Such annuity shall be computed at the rate of 21/2% of his average pay for each year of service up to 20 years of service and at the rate of 3% of his average pay for each year of service after 20 years of service, or, in the case of a member who first became such a member after the end of the 90-day period beginning on July 1, 1977, after 25 years of service, except that such annuity may not exceed 80% of the average pay of such member.</p>

Such redeposit (and the required interest thereon) may, at the election of the member, be made in a lump sum or in not to exceed 60 monthly installments, except that if the member dies before depositing the full amount due under the preceding sentence, the requirements of such sentence shall be deemed to have been met.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Interest shall be paid at a rate which (as determined by the District of Columbia Retirement Board) is equal to the average rate of return on investment (adjusted to the nearest one eighth of 1%) for the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund (established by <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-712.html">§ 1-712</a>) for the period beginning on the 1st day of the 1st month which begins after the end of the service with respect to which the redeposit is made and ending on the last day of the month which precedes the month during which he redeposits the refund if he makes a lump-sum payment or during which he makes the 1st monthly payment if he makes monthly payments, except that for so much of any such period which precedes October 1, 1981, the average rate of interest on interest-bearing obligations of the United States forming a part of the public debt (adjusted to the nearest one eighth of 1%) shall be used in determining the interest rate to be paid on redeposits under this subchapter;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Interest shall be payable for the period beginning on the 1st day of the 1st month which begins after the end of the period of service with respect to which the redeposit is made and ending on the last day of the month which precedes the month during which he redeposits the refund;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> If a member elects to make his redeposit in monthly installments, each monthly payment shall include interest on that portion of the refund which is then being redeposited.</p>
