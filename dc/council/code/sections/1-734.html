The Mayor shall make copies of such retirement program descriptions and annual reports available for public inspection in an appropriate location. The Board shall also furnish to the Mayor, the Council, the Speaker, and the President pro tempore, upon request, any documents relating to the retirement program or the Fund, including any bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instrument under which the retirement program or Fund is operated.</p>
