The term of office of each member of the Review Board shall be 3 years, staggered so that one third of the appointments expire each year. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his or her predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for the remainder of such term.

              <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/13-172.html">D.C. Law 13-172</a> repealed par. (c)(5), which had read:</p>
              <p>“Consider applications to designate historic landmarks under the contested case procedures contained in § 1-1509.”</p>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/16-185.html">D.C. Law 16-185</a>, in subsec. (a), substituted “comprised of nine members who” for “whose members” and deleted the last sentence which had read: “Any body which functions as the District of Columbia State Review Board pursuant to the Act of October 15, 1966 ( 16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.) as of the effective date of this subchapter, shall function as the Review Board pursuant to this section until a Review Board is established and its members nominated by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council of the District of Columbia pursuant to this section.”; in subsec, (b), inserted “The term of office of each member of the Review Board shall be 3 years, staggered so that one third of the appointments expire each year. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his or her predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for the remainder of such term. Upon expiration of his or her term of office, a member shall continue to serve until his or her successor is appointed.”; in subsec. (d)(1), substituted “during the 12-month period after the denial” for “within 12 months of the denial”; and, in subsec. (d)(2), substituted “the Review Board shall not accept a new application for the same property during the 12-month period following the withdrawal” for “no more than 1 new application may be filed 12 months from the date that the application is withdrawn”.</p>

              <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
              <p>Because of the codification of <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/5-69.html">D.C. Law 5-69</a> as <a class="" href="/dc/council/code/titles/6/chapters/11/subchapters/II/">subchapter II of this chapter</a>, and the designation of the preexisting text of Chapter 11 as subchapter I, “subchapter” has been substituted for “chapter,” where applicable, in this section.</p>
              <p>Section 20(c) of <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/13-313.html">D.C. Law 13-313</a>, amends <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/13-172.html">D.C. Law 13-172</a> by adding a new section 403a which provided:</p>
              <p>Sec. 403a. Applicability. “Section 403(a) and (b)(1)(A) and (B) shall apply only prospectively to hearings held by the Mayor or the Historic Preservation Board after the effective date of this title.”</p>
