The term “branch” as used in this section shall be held to include any branch bank, branch office, branch agency, additional office, or any place of business located in the District of Columbia, at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent, or at which the public is served or any phase of business conducted by the parent institution or unless the branch is otherwise permitted by applicable law of the District of Columbia or by federal law.</p>

Law 6-107</a>], any solvent financial institution in the District of Columbia under the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency may go into liquidation and discontinue business by the vote of its shareholders owning two-thirds of its stock. Whenever a vote is taken to go into liquidation it shall be the duty of the board of directors to cause notice of this fact to be certified, under the seal of the institution, by its president, secretary, or cashier to the Comptroller of the Currency, and publication thereof to be made for a period of 2 weeks in a newspaper published in the District of Columbia, that the institution has discontinued business and is winding up its affairs, and notifying its creditors to present claims against the institution for payment. The shareholders shall at the time of going into liquidation elect a committee or liquidating agent who shall liquidate the institution. No institution which has gone into voluntary liquidation shall be permitted to resume business but until its liquidation is complete shall remain a legal corporation or association for the purpose of suing or being sued. The liquidating agent shall give satisfactory surety bond to the board of directors of the institution and shall annually, on request of the Comptroller of the Currency, render such reports to the Comptroller as he shall require. Any such institution in liquidation may be examined by the Comptroller of the Currency who, if he finds such institution insolvent, may appoint a receiver and wind up its affairs in the same manner as provided by law for national banking associations.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> If any financial institution under the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency, which has not gone into liquidation and for which a receiver has not already been appointed for other lawful cause, shall discontinue its operations for a period of 60 days, the Comptroller of the Currency may, if he deems it advisable, appoint a receiver for such institution.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Any financial institution over which the Comptroller of the Currency has or had supervision which prior to March 4, 1933, had in any manner ceased to do a banking business shall not resume such banking business and shall advise the Comptroller of the Currency when its business has been fully liquidated, whereupon by operation of this section its charter is terminated. Such financial institution may in the discretion of the Comptroller of the Currency be subject to all provisions of subsection (d) of this section.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Any person, or corporation or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person who participates in the conduct of affairs of the person or corporation that violates any of the provisions of this section shall be punished by:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> A fine not less than $1,000;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Imprisonment not exceeding 1 year; or</p>
