            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Notwithstanding any other law or regulation, the Mayor may enter into an agreement with The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (“BNA”), and BNA Washington, Inc. (“BNAW”), to defer, up to 10 years, any real property tax liability on property located on Lot 109 and Lot 883 of Square 24, popularly known as 1227-1231 25th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., or any property in the District of Columbia acquired for headquarters and principal operations as an addition to, or substitute for, the 25th Street address during the term of any deferral agreement.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The amount of real property tax owed during an approved deferment period shall not constitute delinquent taxes nor shall BNA and BNAW be assessed any interest or penalty for the deferment period. The deferral shall be prospective and shall apply only to the specified tax years.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Taxes, including penalty and interest thereon, deferred under this section shall constitute a preferential lien upon the real property which shall be payable immediately by the seller, transferor, or conveyor whenever the real property is sold, transferred, or conveyed in any manner, to an entity other than BNAW or a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNA or whenever additional co-owners (other than BNA or a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNA) are added to the real property.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> In no event shall the deferral granted pursuant to this section be transferable.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> As a condition to the grant of tax benefits under this section, BNA and BNAW shall submit to the Mayor by March 31st of each tax year an affidavit, signed under penalty of perjury. The affidavit shall contain the following averments or documentation of same establishing that after reasonable investigation, the undersigned have determined that BNA and BNAW:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> Have met and intend to continue to meet the requirements applicable to the receipt of the real property tax deferral pursuant to the Agreement;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> Are in compliance with the terms of all public benefit agreements entered into with the District;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> Have recorded as an obligation all unpaid taxes on the subject property in their financial statements;</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)">(4)</span> Are not now receiving and do not now have pending any other application for forgiveness of the obligation to pay any taxes, or for the abatement of real property tax liability imposed by the District, except as provided in <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-825.01.html">§ 47-825.01</a> [repealed] and subsection (i) of this section;</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(6)">(6)</span> Are not in violation of the laws and regulations of the District.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> The Mayor shall make an annual determination of the compliance by BNA and BNAW with the requirements of this section and the Agreement under this section.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> If the Mayor determines that BNA and BNAW are in compliance, the Mayor shall issue to BNA and BNAW and to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue (“Director”) a certificate of compliance.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> If the Mayor determines that BNA and BNAW are not in compliance, and after the Mayor gives to BNA and BNAW written notice and a reasonable time to cure the noncompliance or default and BNA and BNAW fail to cure the noncompliance or default, the Mayor shall issue to BNA and BNAW and to the Director a certificate of noncompliance and shall direct that BNA and BNAW be billed for the assessment based on the accumulated tax liability as if the deferment had not been approved. The Mayor may waive, in whole or in part, interest and penalties, when, in his or her judgment, such waiver would be in the public interest.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> Any assessment pursuant to a determination of noncompliance shall be due and payable by March 31st following the end of the tax year in which the certificate of noncompliance was issued.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span><span class="level-num" id="(i)(1)">(1)</span> If BNA and BNAW are aggrieved by any assessment of accumulated real property tax, penalty, and interest on real property owned by BNA or BNAW covered by the Agreement and this section, BNA and BNAW may appeal from the assessment in the same manner and to the same extent as provided in <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-825.01.html">§ 47-825.01</a> [repealed] and in §§ <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-3303.html">47-3303</a> and <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-3304.html">47-3304</a>; provided, however, that the deferred real property taxes need not first be paid.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> At the termination of the 10-year deferral period, BNA and BNAW shall be responsible for the payment of the deferred real property tax notwithstanding the pendency of any administrative or judicial challenge to a real property tax levy or assessment.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> The Mayor is authorized to develop the necessary forms and procedures, and to promulgate regulations, necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
