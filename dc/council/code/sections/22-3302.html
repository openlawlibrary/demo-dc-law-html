              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/16-306.html">D.C. Law 16-306</a> inserted: “The presence of a person in any private dwelling, building, or other property that is otherwise vacant and boarded-up or otherwise secured in a manner that conveys that it is vacant and not to be entered, or displays a no trespassing sign, shall be prima facie evidence that any person found in such property has entered against the will of the person in legal possession of the property.”</p>
              <p><a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/18-88.html">D.C. Law 18-88</a> rewrote the section, which had read as follows: “Any person who, without lawful authority, shall enter, or attempt to enter, any public or private dwelling, building, or other property, or part of such dwelling, building, or other property, against the will of the lawful occupant or of the person lawfully in charge thereof, or being therein or thereon, without lawful authority to remain therein or thereon shall refuse to quit the same on the demand of the lawful occupant, or of the person lawfully in charge thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment in the Jail for not more than 6 months, or both, in the discretion of the court. The presence of a person in any private dwelling, building, or other property that is otherwise vacant and boarded-up or otherwise secured in a manner that conveys that it is vacant and not to be entered, or displays a no trespassing sign, shall be prima facie evidence that any person found in such property has entered against the will of the person in legal possession of the property.”</p>
              <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="" href="/dc/council/laws/19-317.html">D.C. Law 19-317</a> substituted “not more than the amount set forth in <a class="no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-3571.01.html">§ 22-3571.01</a>” for “not more than $1,000” in (a)(1) and (b).</p>
